<!--<p>
	My current situation is that of looking for my first full-time job and figuring out what it is, exactly, I want to be doing in my ideal future.
	A common thought I have been having recently is projects that would fix a problem that either I have or I have observed someone else having.
	I have been trying to keep track of these ideas and turn them into projects that I can use to develop my skills and prove my abilities.
	<!-- If you have a position or project that you think I would be suitable for, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
	I do know that I would prefer to stay in New Zealand for the time being - dual citizenship is too nice to pass up and I like it here
