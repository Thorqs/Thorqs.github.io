	Bioengineering is a field with an exceptional amount of interdisciplinary knowledge required, depending on the area of specialisation within the field.
	There are those that focus on the design of medical devices, those that work to develop new materials to be used with the body, those who specialise in microbiology or anatomy, and those who support the others.
	As you can see, my background and experience thus far gave me an excellent grounding for the engineering and design side of bioengineering.
	This left much of the biology knowledge yet unlearned.
</p>
<p>
	Most of my lecturers, and later supervisors, had biology (specifically biochemistry) as their specialty with knowledge of engineering as it related to bioengineering.
	This left me a somewhat steep learning curve, but they were good to learn from as their knowledge was quite complete.
	There were certainly some differences in default assumptions in the way some tasks should be carried out, but the fact that iw as the only student doing course work meant that I had plenty of time to ask qusetions of my lecturers.

		BIOE 403 was a paper focused on engineering design with biological constriants in mind.
		These constraints could be how materials interact with human skin or how shape affects grip and comfort; we want scalpels that can be comfortably and reliably gripped regardless of surgical conditions.
		They could also be ways of saving the users from themselves with potential dangerous medical equipment such as X-Ray Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging machines.
		This latter section reinforced my experience in computer science where preventing accidental and intention misuse of the software is a key role in design.
		There was also a focus on frugal innovation and human centred design techniques.
		Frugal innovation being designing products in such a way that the core features are made available at reduced cost. without sacrificing quality.
	</p>
	<p>
		All of this was reinforced through an overarching project throughout the semester.
		The goal of this project was to design a system under the theme of Healthcare for Everyone.
		For me, this took the form of a way for remote communities to get access to cheap and effective eye care.
		In designing my prototype, I learned about and practiced computer aided design with SOLIDWORKS and additive manufacturing with fused deposition modelling.
		Creating a modular design, for example, allowed for parts of my prototype to be made from different materisl for different purposes and for only the broken parts to need replacing, thus reducing cost for the consumer.

<p>
	This programme was designed to provide students that had already completed an undergraduate degree with the functional equivalent of a major in computer science.
	The programme took place over the course of just over a year; two summer semesters, a spring semester, and a fall semester.
	Personal highlights of the programme, for me, were the artificial intelligence paper that went over various common applications of machine learning and the game development and software engineering papers where I was able to learn more about the product development life-cycle.
</p>
<p>
	I think learning about the project development lifecycle, especially the advantages and disadvantages of various common approaches, was especially useful for me because this was not omething I had formally engaged with since high school.

	This masters program was designed with the goal of getting science graduates prepared for working in industry.
	They tried to do this by teaching skills desired by those in industry and, in place of a thesis, three reports over the course of a nine-month internship.
</p>
<p>
	In my case I managed to organise a fixed-term research assistantship at the University of Otago in one of their quantum optics research groups.
	Details about this can be found later on this page.
	One of the key skills I developed here, in addition to learning various new technologies, was keeping intellectual property concerns in mind while writing my reports back to University of Oregon about what I was working on.

<p>
	One of the things that made my time at UPS special was the requirement that we take classes outside of our majors.
	This took the form of taking two from a handful of papers during my first year as well as at least one paper from the categories of maths, physical sciences, social sciences, fine arts, and humanities.
	We also had a foreign language requirement and an upper division (300-level or higher) paper outside of our major.
</p>
<p>
	On the whole, I enjoyed this.
	The favourite subject this turned me onto was Science, Technology, and Society.
	As the name implies, the STS department were interested in the roles that science and technology take in society and their influence on its development.
	The papers I took focused the history of science and its controversies.
