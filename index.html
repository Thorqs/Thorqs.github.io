  <h1>Hello, and welcome to my website</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Quinn.
    You also may know me by my typical screen name of Sionth.
    Regardless, welcome.
    This website is meant to serve as a sort of personal portfolio of my work, among other things.
  </p>
  <p>
    To briefly introduce myself: I was born in the U.S.A. and call New Zealand home.
    Formally, I have studied physics and computer science to the levels of a Master of Science and Diploma for Graduates respectively.
    It should be no surprise, then, when I say that I very much like learning about the mechanics of various systems and optimisations possible within them.
    This extends to my hobbies with me enjoying games with strategy elements and general tinkering.
  </p>
  <p>
    If this all sounds interesting then I recommend that you follow the links at the top of the page.
    There is a link to an electronic form of my CV, for example, as well as a directory for some of my featured projects.
    If you would like to get in contact with me there is an email link at the bottom of the page.
    You can also find other places that I have an online presence there as well, such as Github.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, I would like to say that this website is also one of my projects and I will be working to improve it over time.
    Thank you for your understanding and I hope your enjoy your time here.
  </p>
