title: Termaline Story
---

Things were better before the rime began. Endless snow and endless hunger hung over the people of Termaline in equal measure. That's not to say the town was dreary. Quite the opposite. Threads of wizard light criss-crossed the town in a rainbow of colours, like the night before a festival. Little  homonculi, dragons, and manticors were carved into many of the older buildings and they danced as the threads swung in the wind.
It was the only way the little town could see, you see. After all, the land was cursed. And while the curse remained, no sun would rise over the land that the maiden had chosen for her own.

---

Today wasn't a bad day by Tok's estimation. It was awful. He stared long and slow at the broken lock on the yak shed and let out a tired breath. He'd have to pull the snow-cart himself now. That wasn't going to be easy, he thought while rubbing some warmth into his chin. Actually, it was going to be a flaming hassle. 
Snow had piled up over night and kept Tok from closing the shed's doors. He shook his head. "Discourteous bastards,"  he rasped in the frigid air.
Stamping his way into the empty barn to keep his footing firm in the snow, Tok took the old shovel down from its hook.  It wasn't a pretty shovel but it was serviceable. And, it was his after all.
*Looks like work starts closer to home today,* he thought sourly as he started shoveling snow out of the shed with practiced efficiency. 
Once the snow was out of the shed he cracked his back, closed the doors, and hooked the broken lock around to keep them in place. *But by the salty bitch's balls was it cold!* His gaze swept the area around his house idly. The only light came from the wizard thread which looped through anything that jutted out. Usually from dragon and chimera carvings that adorned the older houses, but sometimes the odd street sign would do the honours. (Which certainly made for a festive Street sign.) They threw colour and light onto the snow blanketed roads and houses like a confused painter who became too popular too quickly. 
There were no walls between the houses, there never had been. An odd thing, Tok thought, for a town well over 200 years. 
Shaking himself for warmth he swung his shovel over his shoulder and started trudging around the house to bring the cart around.


Fortunately Tok's cart was still where he'd left it: on the south-east side of the house to keep the wind from piling snow around her. Despite this, a layer of snow had piled up on the oil skin tarp Tok had laid over it last night. With the ease of a task made into a routine Tok removed the tarp and broke the ice around the axles.
She was an old thing, Tok's cart. Not one length of wood left from the day Tok bought her. Every piece swapped out over the years during one repair or another. In that light you could say the cart was always new really. Tok gave the earth stained wood a sentimental rub and moved around to the front.


Tracks probably would have made moving the cart easier. It certainly didn't help not being able to reach the rails Tok normally hitched the yaks to. He'd had to tie on a hasty crossbar just to push it.
Despite this, he did his best to move quickly past the windows of the house. Head low, not wishing to be seen. His welp, So'tok, was already sick and he didn't want to add worried on top of that. They needed their rest. And food, but everyone needed that.


He was about ready to pull the cart onto the main road when he heard the distinct click of the door latch. His muscles tensed up instinctively, he was in for it now he was sure. 
"Ho, Tok!" called an old familiar voice. Tok let himself ease up a little.
"Felligast," Tok said nodding his head politely and starting to walk. He waited until Felligast fell in step beside him before asking: "How is So'ok doing?"
"Still not well I'm afraid. My magic seems to be losing its effectiveness." 
"Can magic do that? Isn't it, you know, *magic*?"
"So'ok is *sick* Tok. I can heal wounds but not sickness." Felligast shook his head and took on the stern face that spellcasters took on whenever they were about to explain something perfectly obvious to someone who wasn't going to understand it.
"It's in the blood, you see? All I'm really doing is repairing the tissue damage the sickness does each day. Not removing it." Felligast sighed, "Tok. You *need* to order some medicine in from Bryn Shander."
Tok groaned internally, he should have just sold the yaks when he had the chance. He knew he didn't have the money. The Rime had So'ok and him living day to day. But just telling Felligast that wouldn't make him understand. People like Falligast saw *the big picture*. As quotas, log books, and schedules peppered with words like scarious and antheridium. To Falligast not having enough was the difference of a week.
That wasn't to say that Falligast was a bad person. They'd known each other for years. I was just that his sense of empathy could rival a hammer's.
Snow crunched under his boots as he thought about what to say. Words wouldn't work here, he'd have to show Falligast he really had no other choice. 
Tok stopped at the start of market road and rubbed some dirt off his shovel contemplatively. "Could always brave the mines," he said slowly. 
"Don't be rash! No one, who's gone in, has come back out," said Felligast.
"Sounds like there's a demand then."
"Demand for what? Sick orphans?  You know what will happen if you don't come back," Felligast hissed.
Tok held out his hands to either side and shrugged. "The same thing that will happen if I don't. What other choice do I have Felligast?"
"You... You don't have to go back there Tok. How about we go see Speaker Masthew?"
"Oarus? Can't. It's all he can do to pay me to do a job no one needs doing."
"He's *in charge* Tok. Surely he's got something ferreted away in that decrepit house of his," Felligast insisted. "Look, the farm is constantly on the edge of bankruptcy and yet he manages to help pay for sulfur dusting."
Tok stared down the street his gaze lingering on the fresh snow reaching up to engulfe the houses. He found himself idlely working out how long it would take to unearth the worst of them without the yaks. It wasn't possible, not at his age.
"Alright," he said.

---

It didn't take long to walk over to the old manor that was where the speaker was permitted to make their abode. It didn't take long to walk anywhere in Termaline Tok mused. When they got there Oarus' paper shuffling clerk (*Saff*, Tok thought their name was) greeted them and waved them through. 
They found Oarus bent over a slanted desk with one hand hesitantly scribbling notes while the other reluctantly toyed with an abacus. His half-orcan features set in an expression of intense concentration but he relaxed when he noticed Felligast and Tok came in. 
"Ah, gentlemen. An excellent time for a break! To what do I owe and all those formalities," he said waving a hand toward some chairs around a small hearth. "Tea?" Oarus asked, briskly walking over to a cupboard.
"Uh... Sure, thanks Oarus," Tok replied before he and Felligast took the proffered seats. 
Rosy coals slumbered away pushing the ever present rime into the corners of the office. Tok looked over his shoulder to see Oarus tutting away over the contents of his cupboard. The years of isolation had barely made a dent in the young half-orc's tea collection. "Something merry with a bit of bite, gentlemen? I believe I still have one of my Elven mixes..." 
Only once some wood had been tossed on the smouldering coals and a kettle left to brew above them did Oarus sit down. "All right then. What brings you to see me today?"
Tok looked into the speaker's friendly eyes and composed himself. If he couldn't get over himself now when could he? "Oarus, I-"
"Well, it's like this Oarus," interjected Felligast. "So'ok needs medicine and Tok here can't afford any." 
Oarus' smile faded. "Ah, that's not good news" he mumbled in a reserved tone. He stared into the fire for a few minutes. Tok watched the half-orc's mouth move as he tried a few soundless words, giving them to the flames. Finally Oarus shook his head and looked up at Tok. "There's none left," he said. 
"What? No medicine?" Tok asked.
"No, none." 
"Can some be bought from Bryn Shander?"
"I'm afraid not," Oarus replied, looking down and starting into his tea and taking a deep breath. "We can't afford it." 
"Come now, you said that last month and yet you've helped the farm afford all the things we can't just magic into existence" said Felligast. 
"That was last month and this is now!" his temper flaring up. "If your mages don't get what they need to grow those crops the whole town will suffer from-" he paused, his mouth silently exploring the next word "malnoreeshmant." "And..." His anger subsiding "...I've already scraped everything I can. I've already had to cut the Guard's wages in half to make up the difference, Felligast. Look, I'm sorry Tok. Really, I am."

---

Felligast and Tok walked out of the speaker's house 5 minutes later in silence. Tok was shaking. "I'll ask the merchants for a loan..." he began.
"You and everyone else," said Felligast cutting him off. "Without collateral no merchant would even consider it these days."
"What about you Felligast?" Ventured Tok.
"I wish I could Tok but spellbotany  doesn't pay at all. Anything the farm makes goes back in and Oarus has us  charging the bare minimum. Otherwise the town would be living solely on trout."
Tok ground his teeth in frustration. "What would you have me *do* then Felligast?" he spat. "I'd sell my house if I could but everyone wants to leave Ten Towns, not move in!"
Felligast opened his mouth to reply, closed it, and opened it again. "I'll ask around town too."

---

The wind from Kelvin's cairn had picked  up. It whistled through the streets, sharp and uncaring. Looking to steal the heat from those walking the streets in the early hours of the Maiden's aurora.
Tok tried to ignore the devilish wind as he went from door to door asking anyone better off than him for a loan.
Many were sympathetic. Many had well meaning suggestions. None offered to help.
Tok's heavy foot falls forced their way through the snowy roads, collapsing any old footprint that got between him and the next door. Many of them where his own. The effect was a maddened path winding through the streets of Termaline moving ever closer to the mine. By the time Tok's mind caught up with his errant feet he was already half a mile out of town. 

He came to a slow stop in the snow. *I don't want to go in there,* Tok thought. *But I must.* He looked down at his hand, he hadn't realised that he'd been gripping his shovel so tightly. 
It was a good shovel.
Tok drew in a long breath and took a step forward.
"Sc'ooze me, mister?"
Tok turned towards were the voice had come from. One of the orphan children from town was looking up at him through a tangled mat of hair framed in thin cheep hide. He looked cold. Probably colder than Tok in any case.
"You shouldn't be here, lad. Ain't nothing this way but the mine" Tok began, crouching down to eye level.
"Don' wanna be 'ere, mister. But some bloke's payin' me a plat to put this here note in your 'and." 
Tok frowned, a plat was good money. Especially for an orphan. But Tok didn't know anyone who could throw that kind of weight around."Could you describe them?" 
The lad's brow crinkled in intense thought. After a few seconds they eased up and shrugged. "Jus' some ol' guy, mister," they said and held out a folded piece of paper.
Tok took the proffered note and opened it. A single neat word crouched in the fold of the page: "oops." 
Mist obscured Tok's vision and before he could lift his eyes a weight dropped down onto his shoulders forcing him to hunch forward. Two legs locked themselves around his neck and a knife obscured a rather large portion of Tok's view.
"Your parents ever teach you to play with knives mister?"
Tok considered his options. Really it was just two, and they were fighting over what little space was available in his head. His shoulders said:*it's a kid, surely I can simply throw them.*  But his eyes said: *that's a big knife.* Somewhere, a third thought slunk in while the other two scrapped. It was his mouth and it said: "magic."
"That's right mister!" the child replied in a voice full of pride. "Now, I'm not *planning* to kill you. Just wanted you to know it's easy is all." 
The knife snapped out of sight and two hands pulled Tok's head back. Two mud brown eyes stared into Tok's. Tok was used to being looked down on by those who he didn't get on with but this was a new experience. His back wasn't comfortable, neither was his neck to be fair, and he was too afraid to upset the mage. Elven mage he corrected himself, noticing a pointed ear sticking out of the mess of tangled hair.
"What do you want?" he whispered. 
The child grinned; it didn't make Tok feel at ease. Especially when it began to fade into mist, reforming into the lad a few metres away to Tok's left. "Rumor has it you're looking for money Mister," they said. "And Wercs is looking for a mule. One too scared to cross me."
Tok's mind was having trouble keeping up at this point. But if the shady kid could help him... What choice did he have?
"What kind of mule?" Tok asked. 

---

The deal was straightforward. Tok just had to undermine the town speaker. Specifically he needed to *bribe* the town guard to overtly disregard Oarus. Keep the peace but ignore petty crimes committed against his supporters and the like. 
When Tok pointed out the flaw in this plan the lad, Wercs, threw a bag of coins at him. All platinum. Told him that since he was known in the town he just needed to talk down Oarus as though Tok wanted to run for speaker. When he asked how he'd explain the money the lad had looked over his shoulder down the road and said "no one else could brave the mine, right?"
Tok walked slowly down the road back to Termaline. Wercs had roughed him up so he'd look like he'd been in the mine and he was distinctly aware of the falsehood. 
"I braved the mine and survived," he said aloud to test the words. Every one of them felt like an eel writhing in his stomach. He struggled to fight down a shiver. He *really* didn't like this.
Worse still, he wasn't sure how he'd talk to the guard. Certainly they wouldn't be looking at Oarus favourably, not after he'd docked their pay. But it didn't feel *right*. Nevertheless, if it meant he could afford the medication So'ok needed, he'd do what he had to.

---

The sky above Termaline was dark now. The maiden's aurora had faded and it would be a good four hours before the sun "rose" and washed Icewind Dale in twilight. Not that it meant anything to Termaline. The Wizard lights shone with brilliant indifference. 
Their light fell on the front of a large wooden building and coloured it a muddy orange. Chimera and homonculi hung beneath the eaves, staring hungrily at anyone who walked by. Someone had nailed a sign above the front double doors many years ago, the  paint had faded a bit but it still served to inform the everyday pedestrian that this was where you'd find the "Town Gard."
Tok dragged his feet up to the doors, opened one, and stepped through the threshold. He entered a small vestibule which had been repurposed as a lobby with doors on either side. On the opposite wall a lanky teenager sat at desk covered with wood polish and crossbow parts. The kid in question was mumbling under their breath while miticulously cleaning each part. 
"Sorry, but are you a criminal?" he asked without looking up. 
"Not today Thero," Tok replied. "But keep trying."
"Then I'll need you to wait here. Very busy today. Very busy."
Tok looked around. "There's no one else here," he observed. 
"True, but if I dant have this crossbow clean before ma sees she'll give me a hiding."
"I'm not waiting today Thero." Tok was quite pleased, his voice only sounded a little concerned. Not that he should be, no one could prove anything. He hadn't betrayed Oarus. It was just a job. None the less, Thero frowned at Tok's tone and looked up at him, his gaze flicked up and down and Tok was reminded of how he looked again. "You look like you've been rolling around in the dirt," said Thero.
"Just dirty from work."
The kid grinned, "I'll bet ma- I mean, the *captain*, wouldn't mind a bit of dirt if it meant they could help someone in need. Go on through." 
Tok walked to the door that led to the on-duty quarters and rested his hand on the handle. "You're not fooling anyone Thero," he said. 
Thero shrugged their shoulders, their face buttery with innocence. "I'm just helping a citizen in need."
Tok grunted in reply. Although he knew he shouldn't be, he was grateful for the kid's insolence. But only for today. He pushed open the door and walked through a medium sized room with about 8 desks. Only three of them were being used. Not that it mattered to Tok. He walked straight to the other end of the room and knocked on a door labelled "Captain". 
And then he knocked again a minute later.
And again.
And again.
      "WHAT!?" screamed  a broad shouldered woman opening the door. Her hair was neck length and her eyes were an angry bright blue.
     "Hi Captain Claire," said Tok wiping a little spittle from his face. "Do you have a few minutes?"
     The woman calmed down a few shades, her irises changing to deep a forest brown. "Today's not a good day Tok," she said. 
      Tok smiled grimly. "Tell me about it.  I'm guessing it's gold?"
       Claire's eyes flared a bright blue again. "You're damn right it's gold," she snarled. "It's always gold! Do you know how many more thefts there have been since food became scarce?
      "*And* we're being overworked just attempting to track them all! And now.... The nerve of Oarus! The guard needs to eat too, you know? We don't have the *time* to go foraging for it." Clair cut in before Tok could reply.
     Tok waited a few seconds until he was sure Clair was done and taking careful note of her still blue irises before hazarding: "Wage cut that bad?"
      She glared at him. "Yes," she replied flatly. Then Claire smiled sweetly; asked "but what can I do for you today kind citizen?" 
     Tok paused. Claire was cursed so she couldn't hide her emotions. But she knew anyone who knew her was aware of that. Unfortunately, that meant she didn't bother restraining herself. The way she saw it, they'd been warned. And he knew she knew he knew that.
      Tok looked over his shoulder. The rest of the guard appeared to be hard at work. Specifically staying out of Claire's way.
      "Business..." He replied slowly, watching Claire as he announciated each syllable. 
      Claire laughed. "Your don't have any money Tok. And even if you did, you look like you just got jumped by out of towners."
       *This is getting me nowhere* Tok thought rubbing some of the dirt on his face self conciously. He took a breath and spoke the words he'd been practicing on the way here. "Captain, today I braved the mine. And well, uh..." He paused awkwardly, "I'd like to talk to you about it." After a moment he added, "Preferably in private."
      "Right, and what did you see down there *champion?*" Claire mocked.
      Tok thought about how easily the small child could kill him. The possibility of them hiding amongst the rafters; of their eyes on his back even now. He shuddered. Looking Claire in the eyes he said "I- I can't tell you here."
       Something of his thoughts must have come across in his manner because Claire's eyes narrowed. She stepped back and held open the door to her office. 
       Claire kept a tidy office, with little papers stacked in a box labelled "open," others in "ongoing," and some in a cabinet labelled "closed." The cabinet didn't look like it had been opened in some time. Tok really didn't see the point. Either the work got done or it didn't, that sort of grouped it up for you didn't it? 
      The door clicked closed and Claire strode around her desk and sat down. "All right Tok, let's see the blood on the snow."


He confessed he hadn't gone very far into the the mine. Just far enough to dig for some uncut gems in the abandoned carts. Probably just got lucky in any case. 
"That's it? That's all you wanted to tell me?" Claire asked. 
     "No. I'm afraid not." Tok took a deep breath, thought of So'ok, and let it out slowly. "Look Claire I'll be frank. I'm tired of Oarus' methods and think something needs to change." 
      "Oh? And why don't you speak out against him in public instead of my cosy office?"
      "Because I'm Tok. Snow shoveling, copper settling Tok. So I need backing."
      "Really? And after you outlined those reasons why should I back you?"
       He reached down into his pocket for the purse Wercs had given him, pulled it out, and upended it. Coins clinked and chinked as they spilled out onto Claire's desk. "Because I will risk everything if it will make a difference," he replied.
       Claire's eyes were yellow with surprise. She glanced up at Tok and frowned, eyes transitioning to a suspicious grey. "That's a lot of money for a few uncut gems, Tok." She said.
     Tok felt his skin going hot beneath his clothes. He tried to hide it by shrugging and "nonchalantly" taking his parkas off. Which was hard because his fingers felt like they'd been dipped in yak-butter. Throughout the flimsy charade he noticed Claire's irises settle into a deep dark-grey.  Tok sighed. "My yak's were stolen," he said, trying to sound angry enough to explain his flushed skin. "The mine's been closed for awhile now and their isn't anything coming across the pass. High risk high reward Claire." *And I need the money for So'ok,* he thought to himself.
      Claire got up and paced behind her desk. *She doesn't look convinced,* Tok thought. He started edging a little off his chair, weighing up the distance between him, the money, and the door.
       Claire spun smartly and put her hands down on the desk.
       "I don't like this Tok," she said.."It sets a bad precedent."
      *And now I cross the threshold,* Tok thought with self loathing. 
      "You only need to overlook minor acts committed against Oarus' supporters when they happen. And continue investigations for others once more precedented crimes have been handled," he replied trying to sound confident. "And it won't be for long Claire. Just long enough to keep your men afloat until we can get Oarus out of the way and clean up his mess." *And then hopefully I can get out of this mess.*
      Claire's eyes became a pained red. She looked down at the coins spilled across her desk, up at the door to her office, and sighed. "Alright," she said. "But only until Oarus is no longer speaker."
       "Until Oarus is no longer speaker," Tok echoed. "Well, Claire. I think I had better let you get back to work," Tok said standing up with a groan. For a moment Tok thought about asking her to find his yaks but it was overruled by the part of his mind screaming at him to get out and bury his head in the snow.
"I'll come by again but I'll try to keep our chats infrequent enough that no one will wonder," he said as calmly as he could. He Turned to leave with all the non-chalance of a child who just broke a vase. Each step feeling a little too long, a little too hurried. 
        When his hand finally reached the door Claire spoke: "Tok. If you cross me, I will quit my post, hunt you down, and throw us both in a cell."
      "Of course," he replied, his mouth dry. He didn't need to turn around to see what colour her irises would be. Really he didn't want to. 

---

Once Tok was outside he took off through the snow, shovel gripped tightly in his hand. Not until he was sure he was out of sight of the Guard house did he allow himself to lean against a wall and let his pent up fear shake itself through his body. *Deep breaths* he thought,*Deep breaths.* "Fuck," he muttered.
        "It's not good to curse, mister" said an unfortunately familiar voice from above. Tok looked up to see Wercs dangled precariously from a cross-beam below the eaves of the house Tok was presently using for respite. One leg absentmindedly kicked the eaves sending a cascade of snow down into a heap next to Tok. 
       "I did what you asked kid. What do you want now?"
      Another small bag landed in the snow pile next to Tok. "Just maintain 'n leverage," Wercs replied. "Visited Shander for you while you were busy."
      "*For* me?" Tok replied, a sinking feeling growing in his Stomach.
      "Medicine for your daughter. That's what you wanted the money for, right mister? 
        "I was worried she might become a corpse when you went to buy it."
        Tok stared at the unkempt child swinging from the eaves for a few seconds. Hardly older than his own daughter. Wercs grinned and then faded away. Their body becomming flakes of snow that scattered in the wind.
      Tok's shoulders started shaking, he couldn't help it. It started as a throaty chuckle and rose to a belly roar of a laugh. They had him, he thought. Whoever *they* were. And that meant he really was running for speaker. Well to the nine hells with it, everyone knows things were better before Oarus Masthew became speaker.
