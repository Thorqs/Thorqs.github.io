  <h1>Acquisitions Incorporated - Pathfinder Second Edition</h1>
  <h2>A Case of Mistaken Identity</h2>
  <p>
    Our adventure begins with our hope-to-be aventurers in the reception area at the Waterdeep branch of Acquisitions Incorporated.
    Flint Ironfist, Thokk Thokkson, and Abroshtor's grandson are called into their prospective boss's office and take their seats.
    They are left waiting, which leaves Flint to fall asleep in his chair.
    Omin Dran finally enters and informs them all that a fissue has opened up in the recent earthquakes and it is their job to check the tunnels it has openned up so that surveyors can safely chart them.
    He plops a sack containing 100g on the table in forward pay and bids the party adieu.
  </p>
  <p>
    The party look at eachother, shrug, and pocket the gold sack.
    They also wake up Flint.
    On their way out they get pulled aside by someone who definitely isn't Jim Darkmagic, and certainly doesn't resemble the portrait of Jim Darkmagic right behind him.
    They give him raised eyebrows and not-Jim smiles in sympathy and offers them a spell scroll, free of charge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Their next task is finding their way to their destination.
    They meander their way down into the slums and find a stall of "jenuine mapps and poshuns."
  </p>


  <h2>Travel to Neverwinter</h2>
  <p>
    Notcit stumbles into the inn where the rest of the party are working after a somewhat arduous journey.
    He brings with him a note from their employer saying they have been tranferred to external affairs and are to assist with the bounty on endless winter in Icewind Dale.
    Flint decides that, while the rest can head up north to deal with
  </p>
  <p>
    After their various travails on their journey thus far, they awoke to a cloudy day that immediately turns miserable with wind and rain.
    The group wanders into the forest to seek aid and find a small homestead with a mill and farmhouse.
    They knock on the door and find themselves face to face with a hooded old lady.
    She is incredibly friendly and bids them enter and shelter from the storm and, while they're at there, perhaps purchase some of her fine potions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the party are suspicious enough of the woman to scrutinize her appearance and what little they can see of the inside of her house.
    The perceptive among them can tell she is more than a simple old woman; that she is likely a forest hag.
    The less perceptive only notice that she has green skin and that she has various herbs and vials on tables visible from the door.
    Most of the party feel uncomfortable about this and try to back away.
    Enga, meanwhile, is curious.
    She manages to buy a geniune potion from the old lady before the party make their departure into the cold and wet.
  </p>
  <p>
    A wyvern attacks!
    The party thinks about it and the wyvern sets its sights on them.
    Abroshtor tries to remember what he knows about wyverns and recalls that they are saintly folk that love giving rides to travellers.
    The rest of the party are less optimisitic and drag Abroshtor into the forest to force the wyvern to the ground.
    The party sneaks through the forest as best they can to avoid the wyvern's gaze.
    Unfortunately, the wyvern is waiting for them roughly where they would come out.
  </p>
  <p>
    They discuss their plan now and come to Abroshtor luring it further in while notcit sets a spike trap in its path.
    The wyvern is suspicious and stops just before the trap.
    Berodotus runs in to flank and begins hacking at the wyvern, initially missing in his haste.
    The wyvern manages to get a good bite off on berodotus and launches a fireball from its maw at Abroshtor, setting the surrounding forest ablaze.
    It also slaps Notcit with its tail.
    Enga tries to daze the creature
    Notcit makes his best go and also whiffs.
    His snake misses and gets stuck on its wing talon.
    Abroshtor launches a crossbow into its wing.
    Various small hits then berodotus cleaves its wing off, thus felling the beast.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notcit is not one to waste material and takes 10 minutes to skin about half of its hide.
    Berodotus helps by pulling the skin away and Enga helps by slashing chunks of meat for later.
    Berodotus is kind enough to help carry the materials.
    The forest fire continues unabated and claims the wyvern's corpse.
  </p>
  <p>
    After resuming their travels, they see an exhausted tabaxi in a stumbling run.
    This tabaxi generally resembles Notcit, in that he is a cat person with off white fur.
    Abroshtor stops the tabaxi and learns that there are bounty hunters after him, assuming him to be the on on the poster wanted for murder of some nobleman down south's wife.
    It turns out that the tabaxi, unfortunate-feathers, works at the inn their carriage will be leaving from.
  </p>
  <h2>The Journey to Icewind Dale</h2>
  <p>
    The party takes off in the carriages in the morning.
    They are told it will only take them 3 days to get to their destination and that their company has paid for the complete package, which includes a show.
    Satisfied with this, they get into their carriage.
    It is quickly apparent that the weather is getting more dour, mistier, and eventually they are informed they have arrived at their half-way point of Vallaki.
  </p>
  <p>
    The party is given tickets to their show.
    They notice that the entire town is demure and in a gothic aesthetic.
    Berodotus orders some overpriced peanuts (because Barovia).
    Before the show, there is much ado introducing the baroness of the town, Ebony Darkness Dimentia Raven Way.
    At intermission, they are beckoned to meet the mayoress and continue watching from her private box.
  </p>
  <p>
    They all follow suit to the top of theatre where the baroness
    Notcit is taught that grave-robbing is culturally acceptable as long as it's outside of town and as long as you don't get caught; it's like a game.
    Felder is brought up to remind the baroness that her new guests are on a schedule so he would appreciate if she didn't detain them overlong.
    She reluctantly agrees and invites the party back any time if they want forbidden knowledge and the like.

  <h1>Player Characters</h1>
  <h2>Abroshtor - Gnome Cleric 3 - Obviator</h2>
  <p>
    Abroshtor is a rather old gnome.
    He has a well trimmed white beard and messy hair that just seems to have its own mind.
    He is dressed in comfortable black clothes with white accents and a white cloak, but stained with dirt from traveling.
    His staff has the two sided face of Nethys carved into it at the top and he uses it more to help him walk than for fighting.
    During rests, he has to wear glasses to read. While generally in a good mood as typical for gnomes, he got more cautious with time and will be very serious when persuing his goals, or reading Acq. Inc.'s employment contract.
  </p>

  <h2>Berodotus - Beastkin Human Barbarian 3 - Documancer</h2>

  <h2>Drem - Shadow Ratfolk Oracle 3 - Loremonger</h2>

  <h2>Enga - Dragonscale Kobold Witch 3 - Hoardsperson</h2>

  <h2>Flint - Dwarf Champion 3 - Decisionist</h2>
  <p>
    Beyond rusted everything, Flint's got a flaking image of Nethys' emblem emblazoned on his shield and a long bright copper beard which glints with trapped shards of deep brown rust.
    His shield, currently, has a break down the middle which has been haphazardly repaired with leather and wood.
    He'll have a small knife on his hip with a sheath carved to look like a hound's head in the process of biting a some dwarven times, it's  maw agape.
    Beyond this, he has a bone longsword and a knobby two handed staff.
  </p>

  <h2>Captain Notcit Random - Liminal Catfolk Ranger 3 - Intern</h2>
  <p>
    The newest of the party members, sent to the party on internship to learn cultural values after committing some faux pas.
    What, exactly, this faux pas was is lost on him.
    This doesn't bother him much as he is happy to go on an adventure and spread his figurative wings.
  </p>
  <!--things to mention: snake --><button type = "button" class = "collapsible"><b>Appearance and Personality</b></button>
  <div class = "content">
    <h3>Appearance</h3>
    <p>
      Notcit stands roughly 172 cm (5'8") tall, although may appear taller given his large ears.
      He mostly resembles an anthropomorphic sand cat; pale, sandy fur covering most of his face and body with orange-ish brown lines outlining his snout and going from the corners of his eyes to around his cheeks.
      He also has two thicker black bands circling the middle of his arms and thinner ones circling his tail.
      The black continues as specks that trail his spine and tip his ears and tail.
      His chin and stomach furs are just off-white.
    </p>
    <!--<p>
      Clothing wise, Notcit wears a breastplate with leather and cloth accessories suitable for forays into the desert.
      This includes light, loose-fitting clothing
    </p>-->

    <h3>Personality</h3>
    <p>
      Notcit is still somewhat young and naive of cultures other than his own.

    </p>

  </div>
  <button type = "button" class = "collapsible"><b>Backstory</b></button>
  <div class = "content">
    <p>
      Notcit hails from the desert lands of Rahadoum in Golarion.
      As a Shemtej, he is used to a nomadic and passionate lifestyle and has seen his share of oddities.
      His role in the train was to hunt for meat and supplies.
      He worked closely alongside one of the train's leatherworkers, Halhat, to to make use of every part of what he brought back.
    </p>
    <!-- (belief that) all deserts are connected -> wandered from Rahadoum to Calimshan and thought nothing of it. It just happens sometimes. At least it does to Liminal Shemtej -->
    <p>
      At some point, Notcit came to know about the Calimshan branch of Acquisitions Incorporated and journeyed to them in curious hopes of a new experience.
      People always found it easy to get along with Notcit, he just seemd to fit in, and he managed to bluff his way into a sales position.
      All was going well - he had good numbers and his supervisor had high hopes for him - until one business trip where Notcit accidentally offended their client.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drinks were flowing and wealthy pasha that was their client was in deep talks with Notcit's supervisor, leaving Notcit with time on his hands.
      He had been getting to know the concubine serving him drinks and, when all save the pasha and Notcit's supervisor were bidden to leave the room, Notcit cotinued talking to the concubine.
      What had started as politely entertaining guests on the part of the concubine turned into genuine interest and curiosity on their part as Notcit told him tales of his youth.
      One thing led to another and they were back in Notcit's chambers.
      They were still in Notcit's chambers in the morning when another servant was sent to search for the missing concubine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pasha was furious that another would seduce his concubines and demanded Notcit's head.
      Notcit's supervisor managed to talk him down into accepting the company's punishment, with their sincerest apologies.
      A deal was struck, although his supervisor suspected this would not be the end of it.
      Their suspicions were correct.
      The pasha sent assassins to confirm the punishment desired.
      None of this is known to Notcit, all he knows is that he made a cultural blunder and would be sent north to learn more about local culture for a while.
