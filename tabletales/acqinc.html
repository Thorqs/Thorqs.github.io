  <h1>Acquisitions Incorporated - Pathfinder Second Edition</h1>
  <h2>A Case of Mistaken Identity</h2>
  <p>
    Our adventure begins with our hope-to-be aventurers in the reception area at the Waterdeep branch of Acquisitions Incorporated.
    Flint Ironfist, Thokk Thokkson, and Abroshtor's grandson are called into their prospective boss's office and take their seats.
    They are left waiting, which leaves Flint to fall asleep in his chair.
    Omin Dran finally enters and informs them all that a fissue has opened up in the recent earthquakes and it is their job to check the tunnels it has openned up so that surveyors can safely chart them.
    He plops a sack containing 100g on the table in forward pay and bids the party adieu.
  </p>
  <p>
    The party look at eachother, shrug, and pocket the gold sack.
    They also wake up Flint.
    On their way out they get pulled aside by someone who definitely isn't Jim Darkmagic, and certainly doesn't resemble the portrait of Jim Darkmagic right behind him.
    They give him raised eyebrows and not-Jim smiles in sympathy and offers them a spell scroll, free of charge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Their next task is finding their way to their destination.
    They meander their way down into the slums and find a stall of "jenuine mapps and poshuns."
  </p>


  <h2>Travel to Neverwinter</h2>
  <p>
    Notcit stumbles into the inn where the rest of the party are working after a somewhat arduous journey.
    He brings with him a note from their employer saying they have been tranferred to external affairs and are to assist with the bounty on endless winter in Icewind Dale.
    Flint decides that, while the rest can head up north to deal with
  </p>
  <p>
    After their various travails on their journey thus far, they awoke to a cloudy day that immediately turns miserable with wind and rain.
    The group wanders into the forest to seek aid and find a small homestead with a mill and farmhouse.
    They knock on the door and find themselves face to face with a hooded old lady.
    She is incredibly friendly and bids them enter and shelter from the storm and, while they're at there, perhaps purchase some of her fine potions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the party are suspicious enough of the woman to scrutinize her appearance and what little they can see of the inside of her house.
    The perceptive among them can tell she is more than a simple old woman; that she is likely a forest hag.
    The less perceptive only notice that she has green skin and that she has various herbs and vials on tables visible from the door.
    Most of the party feel uncomfortable about this and try to back away.
    Enga, meanwhile, is curious.
    She manages to buy a geniune potion from the old lady before the party make their departure into the cold and wet.
  </p>
  <p>
    A wyvern attacks!
    The party thinks about it and the wyvern sets its sights on them.
    Abroshtor tries to remember what he knows about wyverns and recalls that they are saintly folk that love giving rides to travellers.
    The rest of the party are less optimisitic and drag Abroshtor into the forest to force the wyvern to the ground.
    The party sneaks through the forest as best they can to avoid the wyvern's gaze.
    Unfortunately, the wyvern is waiting for them roughly where they would come out.
  </p>
  <p>
    They discuss their plan now and come to Abroshtor luring it further in while notcit sets a spike trap in its path.
    The wyvern is suspicious and stops just before the trap.
    Berodotus runs in to flank and begins hacking at the wyvern, initially missing in his haste.
    The wyvern manages to get a good bite off on berodotus and launches a fireball from its maw at Abroshtor, setting the surrounding forest ablaze.
    It also slaps Notcit with its tail.
    Enga tries to daze the creature
    Notcit makes his best go and also whiffs.
    His snake misses and gets stuck on its wing talon.
    Abroshtor launches a crossbow into its wing.
    Various small hits then berodotus cleaves its wing off, thus felling the beast.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notcit is not one to waste material and takes 10 minutes to skin about half of its hide.
    Berodotus helps by pulling the skin away and Enga helps by slashing chunks of meat for later.
    Berodotus is kind enough to help carry the materials.
    The forest fire continues unabated and claims the wyvern's corpse.
  </p>
  <p>
    After resuming their travels, they see an exhausted tabaxi in a stumbling run.
    This tabaxi generally resembles Notcit, in that he is a cat person with off white fur.
    Abroshtor stops the tabaxi and learns that there are bounty hunters after him, assuming him to be the on on the poster wanted for murder of some nobleman down south's wife.
    It turns out that the tabaxi, unfortunate-feathers, works at the inn their carriage will be leaving from.
  </p>
  <h2>The Journey to Icewind Dale</h2>
  <p>
    The party takes off in the carriages in the morning.
    They are told it will only take them 3 days to get to their destination and that their company has paid for the complete package, which includes a show.
    Satisfied with this, they get into their carriage.
    It is quickly apparent that the weather is getting more dour, mistier, and eventually they are informed they have arrived at their half-way point of Vallaki.
  </p>
  <p>
    The party is given tickets to their show.
    They notice that the entire town is demure and in a gothic aesthetic.
    Berodotus orders some overpriced peanuts (because Barovia).
    Before the show, there is much ado introducing the baroness of the town, Ebony Darkness Dimentia Raven Way.
    At intermission, they are beckoned to meet the mayoress and continue watching from her private box.
  </p>
  <p>
    They all follow suit to the top of theatre where the baroness
    Notcit is taught that grave-robbing is culturally acceptable as long as it's outside of town and as long as you don't get caught; it's like a game.
    Felder is brought up to remind the baroness that her new guests are on a schedule so he would appreciate if she didn't detain them overlong.
    She reluctantly agrees and invites the party back any time if they want forbidden knowledge and the like.
  </p>
  <p>
    They leave Vallaki once again, hopefully towards their destination.
    It is not long before snowdrifts start piling up either side of the road.
  </p>

  <h2>Investigations in Bremen</h2>
  <p>
    With their spare equipment stashed at the inn, the party sets out to find information about their task in Icewind Dale.
    The Innkeep tells them the ten members of the council of speakers are scattered throughout the town as they meet but rarely.
  </p>
  <p>
    They find Speaker Dorbulgruf Shalescar at the town hall.
    He is a frail old man sitting at a desk doing paperwork.
    His assistant
    He tells them that one day the sun set and never rose.
    He believes it has something to do with the anger of a goddess; the few amng the lulutiuns of the Great Glacier who worshipped her called her Saaukuruk.
    Drem recognises the name to refer to the goddess Auril.
    They can tell these worshipers from others by the fact that they dress as if it were summer.
    Believing themselves to have gotten what they can from Dorbulgruf, they start out for a random one of the five local taverns
  </p>
  <p>
    Before they can get far, they can get accosted by a hooded figure that introduces herself as Denica, a scholar looking into the eternal rime.
    Drem introduces himself as a fellow scholar, of which she is pleasantly surprised.
    He tells her that they too are looking into the Rime.
    Denica states that she can't share all of her research, given she too wishes to solve the riddle, but would be willing to pay the party if they can introduce her to a chwinga.
    She tells them chwingas are nature spirits said to be able to alter the environment in which they live; if she can convince one to turn it summer, all should be well.
    She offers a lantern that glows green in response to the presence of elementals.
    With a deal struck, she tells them they can find her at the Grumpy Moose tavern every night if they need her for anything.
  </p>
  <p>
    They make their way to the Even Keel to see if there is anything else they can learn before they settle in for the night.
    The bar patrons seem amicable enough and the bartender looks up and nods.
    The bartender introduces himself as Popeye Weatherworn.
    He notice the party are not from the area and the party tells him he's observant.
    "I pride myself on knowing all the locals" he proudly announces.
    "I'm sure. You must also know about all the rumours and the like; finger on the pulse." Notcit muses.
    "Why, what were you looking for?" asks Popeye.
    "Magic!" Squeaks Drem.
    "We came to try our hand at solving the endless Rime. Is there anything we should be aware of?" Asks Notcit.
    "Hmm... not much about the Rime; you'd need to find a frost druid, most-like.
     Well, you asked about magic?
     There're rumours of a lake monsters out west.
     There's also an evil wizard due to be put to flame over in Easthaven."
     Beyond this is small talk about Notcit and Drem's origins.
     This earns them an additional round, on the house.
  </p>
  <p>
    Happy with their information from the barkeep, they set out to find some fishermen to corroborate the sea monster rumours.
    They find a pair bemoaning the touch times and, after hovering for a short while, the pair notices the party and bids them join for a round.
    The outspoken of the pair, Grynsk Berylbore asserts the rumours of a sea monster are nothing more than that, but that the rumours are bad for business.
    He eyes Berodotus and asks if they might be looking for work; too many prospects flee due to the rumours.
    The party accepts, finishes their round, and makes their way back to the inn at which they are staying.
    Their rooms are cold, but they each make do in their own ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next morning they go to the supplies store to get snow-shoes to expedite their trekking before they meet for their fishing adventure.
    Unfortunately, nobody in town has snowshoes for sale.
    They grumble and head out to meet the dwarf about fishing.
    Before they can get on the boat, they are accosted by by an androgynous half-elf claiming the monster is very real and they've been looking into the local wildlife.
    They show the party a large bite mark on one of the ships they were going to take out.
    They note that it's curious that only Grynsk's boats that have been attacked and that nobody is really certain about what it is or what it eats; it's presumed that it eats fish.
  </p>
  <p>
    The party goes about collecting some fish in the hopes it works to lure the beast.
    They also return to the inn to convince Dabshabah to help them given her proficiency at swimming and sense of justice.
    Now their only problem is that the boat with a bite-mark out of it.
    Drem and Notcit make quick work of this task with materials around the fields.
  </p>
  <p>
    With their boats sufficiently repaired, the party decides who will take which boat.
    Abroshtor, Enga, and Notcit set out in the ___ while Berodotus and Drem take the ___ and set out in the lead, as they can see better in the dark.
    The water is far from clear and each boat as to navigate around a series of icebergs, with Berodotus scraping against one briefly.
    The journey to open water is otherwise uneventful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once in open water, they cast about for any suspicious sights and, finding nothing, set to fishing.
    Glopp Gloppson clambers atop Neith, Notcit's animal companion, so that Enga can have eyes in the sky.
    Abroshtor, Drem, Enga, and Notcit then set about fishing.
    For the first few hours they each have moderate success.
    Drem, meanwhile, loses his line after the first one and sets about making a bleeding fish lure in hopes of getting the the monster, or other larger beasts, to appear.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notcit then realises that if they find the monster, fighting it within their boats would likely end poorly.
    He rows over to the nearest iceberg, chips a hole in the ice with his shortsword, jams a torch into the hole with snow packed around it, and moors their boat to it.
    Not long after, a large shadow appears under the water.
    It looks as if it was interested in the bleeding fish then swims away.
    Before it does, Drem Commands it to surface.
    Immediately after, Abroshtor shocks it.
  </p>
  <p>
    A long neck snakes out the water and looks at Abroshtor with reproach and Drem with disgust.
    Its gaze settles upon Notcit.
    "You have my attention." it speaks in perfect common.
    "Er... hello. Our zincerezt apologiez. We heard zat zere waz a monzter out in ziz lake and came to zeze waterz to tezt zeze claims." Notcit replies.
    The parties learns that this plesiosaur was awakened by a druid named Ravisim that serves the Frost Maiden.
    They also learn that the plesiosaur has been instructed to attack any boats from bremen and will not compromise on this.
    When Abroshtor apologises for the slight and offers restitution it asks if they would be willing to terrorize Bremen on their behalf.
    Abroshtor counters with an offer to talk to the druid.
    This is accepted.
    Enga takes notes of this beast.
  </p>
  <p>
    They continue fishing for another 2 hours then head back towards town.
    Drem goes explosion fishing and chunks 3 fish and kills 2 more.
    With additional icebergs dodged, they drag their boats up and note the lack of dabshabah.
    This lack is soon remedied with a triumphant thump.
    She lands and asks the party if they had fun.
    She also asks Notcit for her share of the wyvern from earlier.
    Some negotiations later, she has a share she is happy with and Berodotus' share has been increased for the sake of fairness.
  </p>
  <p>
    Back in town, the party returns to their employer and sells some of their fish... and chum.
    Drem talks to the half-elf researcher about their findings.
    Ravisim one of the druids of Auril that was demanding sacrifices.
    Auril has a temple in Luskan.
    There's also wild stuff in Lonelywood.
  </p>
  <p>
    With no better ideas on how to spend their afternoon, the party sets out to obtain snow shoes.
    They visit Old Greg, the misceleneer, to peruse his wares.
    He does show off his snow shoes for inflated rate, along with a dragger frozen in its sheathe and some whale oil.
    The party debates what to buy and Berodotus buys the dagger.
    Enga buys a pair of snow shoes and, eventually, the rest of the party follow suit.
    The do hear about a moose causing trouble in Lonelywood.
  </p>
  <p>
    They return to the inn and settle in for the evening with their various meals of fish.
    Bero has a dish of fish stew, Notcit tries to cook his fish in the desert heat outsode of his window then realises there isn't any in the Dale.
    Drem takes pity and cooks both of their fishes.
    They return to durdling around in the rooms until Kora knocks on their doors to ask if they would like to participate in the Tribute of Ice.
  </p>
  <p>
    They follow Kora out to learn about the Tribute of Ice.
    During the events, Berodotus spies a large bird off in the distance flying with the aurora shimmering behind it, as if renewing it.
    The best Bero and Notcit can tell is that the bird is large and white.
    Notcit asks the leader of the Tribute an learns it is believed to be Auril flying through the sky upon her white rok.
    Bero and Notcit are seen to not have their ice blocks and each takes one.
    Bero is fine, Notcit noticably chilled.
  </p>
  <h3>Onwards to Targos!</h3>
  <p>
    The next morning, the party sets out towards Lonelywood; or, perhaps, Easthaven.
    Regardless, Targos is their next stop.
    They think about buying dog sleds and come to the decision that they are too expensive and a hassle to take care of.
    Berodotus is confident in their map and his forethought of bringing a compass.
    After 15 minutes, the snow picks up.
    After an hour, it is a proper blizzard.
    The marching order is Berodotus, Drem, Ab, Dab, Enga, then Notcit.
  </p>
  <p>
    At one point, Notcit notices Dabshabah and Enga have stopped moving.
    Upon further inspection, he has found a tree.
    Notcit has lost the rest of the party.
    After not hearing from him for a while, the rest of the party start tying eachother together to avoid further separation.
    Enga make loud horns, Drem makes light.
    Notcit barely hears the horn and cautiously heads towards it; worst case scenario, it's raiders that aren't lost.
    Eventually he can make out shadows that might match the rest of the party.
    As he approaches, something darts out between his feet and he instinctively pounces on it.
    He has caught himself a showshoe hare.
  </p>
  <p>
    After reorganizing themselves, they finish tying everyone to everyone else and manage to find the road.
    They take a left and before long they find themselves in view of wooden palisade walls.
    They approach the walls and take notice of the regal symbol split in half yb the open gate.
    They also note the lines of graves along the walls, seemingly in order of age of the ones that rests within.
    Their further approach puts them in range of the guards, who take notice of them and nod as the party continues into town.
    Now in the walls, they busy themselves getting untied so they can go about their business more easily.
  </p>
  <p>
    It becomes quickly obvious that Targos is both a fishing village and much larger than Bremen.
    They follow the first main road north through the town on a general search for somebody to give them information to make the next leg easier.
    If possible, they would like to travel with a local on their way north to the next city before Lonelywood.
    They don't see much that piques their interest until they turn left towards the mild sound of commerce.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, they find a vocal man hocking his wares from an wagon set up as a store front.
    This is just in front of the genral store and the owner of said general store is not looking pleased by this.
    Abroshtor approaches the merchant and strikes up a conversation.
    It turns out that the merchant has just come from Brynshander and is willing to head north, but not all the way to Lonelywood.
    He tells the party they are welcome to shop or find him later at the Luskan Arms Inn later on.
    Notcit elects to scout it out ahead of the party while they talk to him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Abroshtor is the first to find something he wants in the form of a colourful poncho that could, hopefully, be refashioned into some nice warm clothes for his dog.
    There's also an interesting jar of oil that catches his eye.
    The merchant raises an eyebrow and tells them it's whale oil; a very popular product.
    To Bero's eye, this is no mere whale oil.
    It's exact nature is unknown.
    Satisfied, Abroshtor purchases the oil along with the poncho.
  </p>
  <p>
    The party make their way to Luskan Arms to plan their next move over lunch.
    Notcit is coming down the stairs from the upper floors around this time and they greet eachother again.
    They each order themselves food and a room and set about their lunch.
    A tiefling makes his way in, asks for "the usual" from the bartender, and sits at a table.
    This man is obviously the most interesting person in the bar and so they descend upon him.
    From this, they learn that he is a guard and that there is a speaker upstairs that may have answers to the questions they seek.
  </p>
  <p>
    They head up the stairs to talk with him.
    Abroshtor knocks on the door and the group are let in.
    The information they acquire is: followers of the frost maiden are known to be resistant to cold, the moose problem in Lonelywood may be related to the druids, there may be a meeting in Bryn'shander coming up where speares will meet, and the there are not many that worship her.
    Bero asks after how one may become a follower and gets the standard "worship her, pay tribute..." and that someone that may know more could be in Bryn'shander given it's one of the larger towns.
    Auril, in particular, seeks for the denizens of the land to sacrifice unto her their warmth and feed their bodies to the beasts of the land.
    Bero is convinced that these "beasts" may be druids.
  </p>
  <p>
    After their eeting, each member of the party goes their separate ways.
    Bero wants to check the library for additional information, Notcit wants to hobnob, Abroshtor wants to get prepare new spells, and Enga learns about the nature of the Tribute.
    Enga learns that the tributes are, in fact, human sacrifices in the form of prisoners and that there will be one tonight.
    Enga also invites everyone to observe.
  </p>
  <p>
    The party heads out along with the rest of the townsfolk and watch as a man is dragged, naked, kicking and screaming through the streets, pushed out of the gates of town, and shut out.
    While he is being dragged, he looked to Enga and pleased for help before being kicked by the escourting guard.
    The man continues screaming and the party elects to go to the top of the pallisade to watch him.
    Abroshtor decides to take pity on the man and tasks to be lowered over the wall to "talk to the sacrifice".
    The guards are willing to lower him and allows him to be pulled back up.
  </p>
  <p>
    Abroshtor casts <i>Endure Elements</i> on the sacrifice.
    The sacrifice is a bad actor and Abroshtor gets questioned by the guards, eventually brought bac kto the inn and placed under house arrest by the speaker.
  </p>
  <p>
    With nothing to do for a couple days, Berodotus and Notcit elect to go fishing.
    Drem gets to tinkering.
    Notcit soon comes to regret not staying in town to craft as his second bite pulls him into the frigid waters.
    After a bit of sulking and jeering, Notcit returns to fishing, eventually matching Bero's 6 catches.

  <h2>Captain Notcit Random - Liminal Catfolk Ranger 3 - Intern</h2>
  <p>
    The newest of the party members, sent to the party on internship to learn cultural values after committing some faux pas.

    This doesn't bother him much as he is happy to go on an adventure and spread his figurative wings.
  </p>
  <!--things to mention: snake --><button type = "button" class = "collapsible"><b>Appearance and Personality</b></button>
  <div class = "content">
    <h3>Appearance</h3>
    <p>
      Notcit stands roughly 172 cm (5'8") tall, although may appear taller given his large ears.
      He mostly resembles an anthropomorphic sand cat; pale, sandy fur covering most of his face and body with orange-ish brown lines outlining his snout and going from the corners of his eyes to around his cheeks.
      He also has two thicker black bands circling the middle of his arms and thinner ones circling his tail.
      The black continues as specks that trail his spine and tip his ears and tail.
      His chin and stomach furs are just off-white.
    </p>
    <!--<p>
      Clothing wise, Notcit wears a breastplate with leather and cloth accessories suitable for forays into the desert.
      This includes light, loose-fitting clothing
    </p>-->

    <h3>Personality</h3>
    <p>
      Notcit is still somewhat young and naive of cultures other than his own.
    </p>

  </div>
  <button type = "button" class = "collapsible"><b>Backstory</b></button>
  <div class = "content">
    <p>
      Notcit hails from the desert lands of Rahadoum in Golarion.
      As a Shemtej, he is used to a nomadic and passionate lifestyle and has seen his share of oddities.
      His role in the train was to hunt for meat and supplies.
      He worked closely alongside one of the train's leatherworkers, Halhat, to to make use of every part of what he brought back.
    </p>
    <!-- (belief that) all deserts are connected -> wandered from Rahadoum to Calimshan and thought nothing of it. It just happens sometimes. At least it does to Liminal Shemtej -->
    <p>
      At some point, Notcit came to know about the Calimshan branch of Acquisitions Incorporated and journeyed to them in curious hopes of a new experience.
      People always found it easy to get along with Notcit, he just seemd to fit in, and he managed to bluff his way into a sales position.
      All was going well - he had good numbers and his supervisor had high hopes for him - until one business trip where Notcit accidentally offended their client.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drinks were flowing and wealthy pasha that was their client was in deep talks with Notcit's supervisor, leaving Notcit with time on his hands.
      He had been getting to know the concubine serving him drinks and, when all save the pasha and Notcit's supervisor were bidden to leave the room, Notcit cotinued talking to the concubine.
      What had started as politely entertaining guests on the part of the concubine turned into genuine interest and curiosity on their part as Notcit told him tales of his youth.
      One thing led to another and they were back in Notcit's chambers.
      They were still in Notcit's chambers in the morning when another servant was sent to search for the missing concubine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pasha was furious that another would seduce his concubines and demanded Notcit's head.
      Notcit's supervisor managed to talk him down into accepting the company's punishment, with their sincerest apologies.
      A deal was struck, although his supervisor suspected this would not be the end of it.
      Their suspicions were correct.
      The pasha sent assassins to confirm the punishment desired.
      None of this is known to Notcit, all he knows is that he made a cultural blunder and would be sent north to learn more about local culture for a while.
    </p>
  </div>
  <button type = "button" class = "collapsible"><b>Special Interactions</b></button>
  <div class = "content">
    <h4>Entry to Targos</h4>
    <p>
      While the others were in the market looking at wares, Notcit followed a note slipped to him saying to meet up with his "Dear uncle Naerth" at the Luskan Inn.
      He entered the inn and was immediately addresed by a relatively wealthy looking man with a subtle, yet noticable, tan.
      Notcit is immediately suspicious as he doesn't have much family other than his one uncle which is, most definitely, a catfolk.
      The man bids him upstairs and is quite insistent.
      Having no reason to refuse, yet, Notcit obliges.

      The man's room is nicer than the others in the inn and is found at the far end of the upper floor.
      He closes the door behind Notcit after he enters and bids him sit next to the unlit hearth.
      He tells Notcit that there is a price on his head that many are lining up to claim.
      He is, however, a "generous businessman" and is more troubled by the Rime of his fair and benevolent lady, Auril, than he is by the one-off fee of turning in Notcit's head.
      He also claims to be the owner of this city and tapped into an extremely thorough information network.
      In exchange for Notcit ending the Rime, he is willing to overlook Notcit's bounty.

      Notcit is not entirely pleased by this but goes along with it for now, especially since that is what the group wants.
      He tells "Uncle Naerth" that he believes sharing of information would be beneficial to him accomplishing this mission.
      Specifically, Notcit asks if the tributes he observed in Bremen are believed to be effective as it is readily apparent that this man is a fairly devout follower.
      The answer is yes but... it's not enough, especially on the nights of the new moon.
      He also learns that dragons typically do not make good followers; too self-important.
      Notcit is sent on his way, to return in an hour, and told to not speak of this to anyone else.
      Notcit is happy enough with this.

      Upon Notcit's return, Naerth resumes and reiterates his posturing; adventurers are disposable, etc.
      Naerth then explains what, exactly, it is that he wants.
      He would like for Notcit to find the Frostmaiden and figure out what, exactly, it is that she wants given that the sacrifices aren't helping.
      If she wants additional sacrifices, like the member of the party, give them to her.
      For this reason, it may be wise to keep the party close, although he doesn't particularly care if the party angers or pleases the frostmaiden.
      He is also interested in whatever the followers of Nethys are looking for; probably artifacts.
      Naerth would accept these artifacts in exchange for Notcit's bounty as well.
      He also doesn't really care what happens with Dabshabah, just warning that she's a jerk from the frostmaiden's perspective.
      As Notcit is shown out, Naerth knocks a dagger off a shelf then catches and kicks it into a map with the blade firmly planting itself in the town of Brynshander.
