  <h1>Acquisitions Incorporated - Pathfinder Second Edition</h1>


  <h2>Travel to Neverwinter </h2>
  <p>
    Notcit stumbles into the inn where the rest of the party are working after a somewhat arduous journey.
    He brings with him a note from their employer saying they have been tranferred to external affairs and are to assist with the bounty on endless winter in Icewind Dale.
  </p>
  <p>
    After their various travails on their journey thus far, they awoke to a cloudy day that immediately turns miserable with wind and rain.
    The group wanders into the forest to seek aid and find a small homestead with a mill and farmhouse.
    They knock on the door and find themselves face to face with a hooded old lady.
  </p>
  <p>
    A wyvern attacks!
    The party thinks about it and the wyvern sets its sights on them.

  <h1>Captain Notcit Random - Liminal Catfolk Ranger 3</h1>
  <p>
    The newest of the party members, sent to the party on internship to learn cultural values after committing some faux pas.
    What, exactly, this faux pas was is lost on him.
    This doesn't bother him much as he is happy to go on an adventure and spread his figurative wings.

  <div class = "content">
    <p>
      Notcit hails from the desert lands of Rahadoum in Golarion.
      As a Shemtej, he is used to a nomadic and passionate lifestyle and has seen his share of oddities.
      His role in the train was to hunt for meat and supplies.
      He worked closely alongside one of the train's leatherworkers, Halhat, to to make use of every part of what he brought back.
    </p>
    <!-- (belief that) all deserts are connected -> wandered from Rahadoum to Calimshan and thought nothing of it. It just happens sometimes. At least it does to Liminal Shemtej -->
    <p>
      At some point, Notcit came to know about the Calimshan branch of Acquisitions Incorporated and journeyed to them in curious hopes of a new experience.
      People always found it easy to get along with Notcit, he just seemd to fit in, and he managed to bluff his way into a sales position.
      All was going well - he had good numbers and his supervisor had high hopes for him - until one business trip where Notcit accidentally offended their client.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drinks were flowing and wealthy pasha that was their client was in deep talks with Notcit's supervisor, leaving Notcit with time on his hands.
      He had been getting to know the concubine serving him drinks and, when all save the pasha and Notcit's supervisor were bidden to leave the room, Notcit cotinued talking to the concubine.
      What had started as politely entertaining guests on the part of the concubine turned into genuine interest and curiosity on their part as Notcit told him tales of his youth.
      One thing led to another and they were back in Notcit's chambers.
      They were still in Notcit's chambers in the morning when another servant was sent to search for the missing concubine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pasha was furious that another would seduce his concubines and demanded Notcit's head.
      Notcit's supervisor managed to talk him down into accepting the company's punishment, with their sincerest apologies.
      A deal was struck, although his supervisor suspected this would not be the end of it.
      Their suspicions were correct.
      The pasha sent assassins to confirm the punishment desired.
      None of this is known to Notcit, all he knows is that he made a cultural blunder and would be sent north to learn more about local culture for a while.
