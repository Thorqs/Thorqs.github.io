<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
  Tabletop role-playing games have been a favourite pastime of mine since high school.
  They offer a freedom in collaborative narration that few other media can match.
  Typically, my role is that of the world but on the odd occasion I get the opportunity to be a player.

  What you will find here is a compilation of stories from campaigns that I have been involved with.
  Each will either be named after the character or the campaign and will include the rules system being used.
  Times when I was a character will generally be written with through their lens.
  It's also possible that they may span multiple campaigns in which case their stories will be subdivided.
  Meanwhile, campaigns that I have run may include information to which the party was not privy at the time.
  How to handle this for current games with regards to spoilers is a topic that I am actively considering.

<h1>Campaigns</h1>
<h2><a href = "acqinc.html">Acquisitions Incorporated and Rime of the Frostmaiden</a></h2>
<p>
  With a deadly start in Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition and later transition to Pathfinder second edition, our players start small and gain allies along the way as they seek to climb the ranks of Acquisitions Incorporated.
  Later, they find themselves in Icewind Dale to investigate the cause of their eternal winter.
