<h1>Welcome to Tales from the Table!</h1>
<p>
  Tabletop role-playing games have been a favourite pastime of mine since high school.
  They offer a freedom in collaborative narration that few other media can match.
  Typically, my role is that of the world but on the odd occasion I get the opportunity to be a player.

  What you will find here is a compilation of stories from campaigns that I have been involved with.
  Each will either be named after the character or the campaign and will include the rules system being used.
  Times when I was a character will generally be written with through their lens.
  It's also possible that they may span multiple campaigns in which case their stories will be subdivided.
  Meanwhile, campaigns that I have run may include information to which the party was not privy at the time.
  How to handle this for current games with regards to spoilers is a topic that I am actively considering.
