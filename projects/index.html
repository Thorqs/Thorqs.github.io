  <h1>Physical Objects</h1>
    <h2>Projector</h2>
      <p>
      The goal of this project was to do something useful with the parts from an old laptop.
      This laptop had broken due to a fried motherboard after a grounding pin in the power supply broke off.

  <h1>Computer Games</h1>
    <h2>Alchemaster</h2>
      <p>
      Alchemaster, in its initial form, is a top down tower defense game that I worked on with two other students over the course of 5 weeks.
      This form is still accessible <a href = "/projects/Alchemaster/">here</a>
